# Redis with ASP.net MVC Core Web Application

This is an example application illustrating different methods to integrate Redis into ASP.net MVC core web application.

It is supplementary code for my [Redis InMemory Cache in ASP.net MVC Core](https://garywoodfine.com/redis-inmemory-câ€¦asp-net-mvc-core/) blog post tutorial.

This application is developed using Microsoft .net core so you can run on it on any operating system of your choice as long as you have .net core installed.

It makes use of [Redis an open source](https://redis.io/) , in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

This application will need Redis installed on your computer in order for it too work
